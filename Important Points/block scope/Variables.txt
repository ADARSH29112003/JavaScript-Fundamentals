There is a word I used which is 'A block scope variable' in 'let' and 'const'

So, what is the meaning of A block scope variable?

In all Programming languages a block means curly braces'{}'. So, in this curly braces what ever you write a code that is a one block if you used 

{...code...} - 1st block
{...code...} - 2nd block
{...code...} - 3rd block 
{...code...} - 4th block 
.
.
.
.
and so one.
and one most interesting and fun part is if 1st code for var orlet so that particular block called "var varibale type" or "let varibale type". So and declared, re-declared, update of the value while change all for that particular block where you are writing your code.

 So understanding or not

 if not so jump to the "blockscope.js" file you while understand better.
