FullName = "Tony Stark"; 
// FullName is Varibles and the value is given "Tony Stark"
console.log(FullName);
// To print the value on console we use console.log but without using Quatation Mark ("")
console.log("FullName");
// But if you have to print the only FullName you will use Quatation Mark ("")

// For Better Understanding Let's Take an Example of Age;

Age = 67;
console.log(Age);

// Another Example to understand the Print "If you want to print the word AGE only";

Age = 67;
console.log("Age");
